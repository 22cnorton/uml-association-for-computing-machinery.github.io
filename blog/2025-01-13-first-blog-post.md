Welcome to ACM at UML! My name is Rohan Mallu and I am the chapter president!

Here at ACM at UML, we explore different fields of computer science, from machine learning to kernel development. We also invite guest speakers from other universities to present their research!

Whether you're just getting started in computer science or you're a grad student, ACM at UML has a lot to offer. 

To see our meetings for Spring 2025, go to Meetings and click on Spring 2025

Hope to see you soon!
